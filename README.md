# Doublefox

This is an extension of the [Foxhole game](https://alfille.github.io/foxhole.github.io/) sent to me by my friend DSK.

## Summary

This program is a way to test strategies.

The game is the catch a fox who must move between your hole inspections. The fox moves one hole in either direction. You can look at 2 holes each day.

## Schrödinger's fox

The program shows a [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat) of all the positions the fox could be hiding. Your checking of the holes helps collapse the possibilities.

You check off the holes you want to inspect.

Checking 2 holes is enough for one day!

The fox then moves overnight and you have to look again.

How likely is the fox to be in this hole?


## Other games

If you haven't tried [Foxholes](https://alfille.github.io/foxhole.github.io/), you should. The game is very similar, but the strategy strikingly different.
